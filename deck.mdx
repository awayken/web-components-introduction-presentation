## We have a problem

```notes
As a concept.
Apps are not original vision so devs drive that area.
React, Vue, Angular came to the rescue.
```

## Libraries Come At A Cost

  What if we could do it in the browser?

```notes
They ship with features you won't use,
have bugs you can't fix
create a dependency you can't live without.

 ## Introducing Web Components

  * Create custom, reusable, encapsulated UI
  * Ability to package HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  * APIs can be used or polyfilled for modern browsers


```notes
A set of APIs and features for creating componentized UI.
Independent technologies.
```
---

## Web Components are...

  * Custom Elements API
  * Shadow DOM
  * HTML Templates
  * ES Modules

## Custom Elements API

  * Foundation of Web Components
  * Create new HTML tags
  * Define tags in JavaScript

```notes
Foundation of web components
Make your own HTML elements for fun and profit.
```
---

## Shadow DOM

  * Applies to a custom element
  * Hides the styling and DOM tree
  * Fully encapsulates component from user of component

```notes
Encapsulate your markup and styling.
```
---

## HTML Templates

  * Dormant HTML fragments that can be reused
  * Wrap HTML in `<template>`
  * Import the template node and append

```notes
Dormant: Images don't load, scripts don't run, etc.
```
---

## ES Modules

  * Better way to source JavaScript
  * Adds import and export capability
  * Modular and performant

```notes

```
---

Demo.

---

## We have a problem?

  * Modern browsers only
  * Specs still in flux
  * Not as nice as React

```notes
Polyfills exist, but that's like shipping a library.
v0s of Custom Elements and Shadow DOM are supported but V1 on its ways
Ends up being a bunch of work you have to do yourself
```
