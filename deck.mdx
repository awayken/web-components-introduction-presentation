## We have a problem

<Appear>
  <p>Reusing bits of UI on the web <em>is hard</em>.</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Web started as a place to link text documents.
Today it's a place to do everything.
Apps have different needs than pages.
...
Reusing UI is hard.
```
---

## We've tried to fix it

<Appear>
  <p>YUI, jQueryUI, Dojo, MooTools, Knockout, SproutCore, Bootstrap, Foundation, Material Design for Web, Kendo UI, Adobe AIR, Wakanda, Ember, GWT, Angular, VueJS, Svelte, React, Preact, Postact?</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Let's talk about the history of web UI and all these UI and web app frameworks.
...
List of frameworks
```
---

## These solutions come at a cost

<Appear>
  <p>What if we could do it in the browser?</p>
</Appear>

```notes
They ship with features you won't use,
have bugs you can't fix
create a dependency you can't live without.
...
What if we could do it in the browser?

 ## Introducing Web Components

<Appear>
  <p>Create custom, reusable, encapsulated UI</p>
  <p>Ability to package HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
  <p>APIs can be used or polyfilled for modern browsers</p>
</Appear>

```notes
A set of APIs and features for creating componentized UI.
Independent technologies.
```
---

## Web Components are...

<Appear>
  <p>Custom Elements API</p>
  <p>Shadow DOM</p>
  <p>HTML Templates</p>
  <p>ES Modules</p>
</Appear>

```notes

## Custom Elements API

<Appear>
  <p>Foundation of Web Components</p>
  <p>Create new HTML tags</p>
  <p>Define tags in JavaScript</p>
  <p>"Reactions" give you lifecycle events</p>
  <p>Bring your own render</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Foundation of web components
Make your own HTML elements for fun and profit.
```
---

## Shadow DOM

<Appear>
  <p>Fully encapsulates component from user of component</p>
  <p>DOM elements can't be queried or walked over</p>
  <p>Styles don't leak out or leak in</p>
  <p>As easy as <code>{`this.root = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });`}</code></p>
</Appear>

```notes
Encapsulate your markup and styling.
```
---

## HTML Templates

<Appear>
  <p>Dormant HTML fragments that can be reused</p>
  <p>Wrap HTML in <code>{`<template>`}</code></p>
  <p>Import the template node and append</p>
  <p>You choose how to populate that template</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Dormant: Images don't load, scripts don't run, etc.
```
---

## ES Modules

<Appear>
  <p>Better way to source JavaScript</p>
  <p>Adds import and export capability</p>
  <p>Modular and performant</p>
  <p><code>{`<script type="module" src="app.js" async></script>`}</code></p>
</Appear>

```notes

## Let's use Web Components!

<p>Absolutely! Except...</p>

<Appear>
  <p>Modern browsers (or polyfills)</p>
  <p>Specs evolving into V2</p>
  <p>Bring your own state management</p>
  <p>Bring your own rendering management</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Polyfills exist, but that's like shipping a library.
v0s of Custom Elements and Shadow DOM are supported but V1 on its ways
Ends up being a bunch of work you have to do yourself
I think React beats this out, for now.
