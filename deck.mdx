## We have a problem

<Appear>
  <p>Reusing bits of UI on the web <em>is hard</em>.</p>
  <p>YUI, jQueryUI, Dojo, MooTools, Knockout, SproutCore, Bootstrap, Foundation, Material Design for Web, Kendo UI, Adobe AIR, Wakanda, Ember, GWT, Angular, VueJS, Svelte, React, Preact, Postact?</p>
  <p>What if we could do it in the browser?</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Reusing UI is hard.
We've tried to fix it, but these solutions come at a cost.
They ship with extra features
Have bugs you can't fix
Create a dependency
What if vanilla?
```
---

 ## Introducing Web Components

<Appear>
  <p>Create custom, reusable, encapsulated UI</p>
  <p>Ability to package HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
  <span>Custom Elements API</span>
  <span>, Shadow DOM</span>
  <span>, HTML Templates</span>
</Appear>

```notes
A set of APIs and features for creating componentized UI.
Independent technologies.
```
---

## Custom Elements API

<Appear>
  <p>Foundation of Web Components</p>
  <p>Create new HTML tags in JavaScript</p>
  <p>Lifecycle events, DOM APIs, no library lock-in</p>
  <p>DEMO!</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Foundation of web components.
Make your own HTML elements for fun and profit.
```
---

## Shadow DOM

<Appear>
  <p>Fully encapsulates component from consumer app</p>
  <p>Your DOM elements can't be queried or walked over</p>
  <p>Styles don't leak out and (mostly) don't leak in</p>
  <p>DEMO!</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Fully encapsulates your markup and styling.
```
---

## HTML Templates

<Appear>
  <p>Dormant HTML fragments that can be reused</p>
  <p>Import the template node and insert into DOM</p>
  <p>You choose how to populate your template</p>
  <p>DEMO!</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Images don't load, scripts don't run, etc.
```
---

## Let's use Web Components!

<p>They're great. Some caveats:</p>

<Appear>
  <p>Supported in modern browsers (or with polyfills)</p>
  <p>Specs evolving into V2</p>
  <p>Manage your own state</p>
  <p>Manage your own rendering</p>
</Appear>

```notes
Polyfills exist, but that's like shipping a library.
V1 is stable, but will you have upgrade envy?
State/rendering end up being a bunch of work you have to do yourself
```
